        <h2>About Me</h2>

<p>I am Visalachi, a passionate 3rd-year B.Tech Information Technology student at SNS College of Engineering. With strong problem-solving and time management skills, I have a keen interest in data science and full-stack development.
I have worked on multiple projects, including Fiesta Indiana (a tourism website), Inner Peace AI (a mental health platform), Aara (an image recognition chatbot), and a Library Management System with data visualization. My technical expertise includes Python, Java, C, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, FlutterFlow, SQL, Excel, and Power BI.
I have actively participated in hackathons, idea pitching competitions, and paper presentations, earning recognition at various levels. Recently, I was selected for the Smart India Hackathon (SIH) at the college level. I also enjoy sharing knowledge and recently conducted a career guidance session for 12th-grade students and juniors.
Apart from academics, I have completed internships, including one at Prodigy Infotech, where I worked on projects using Python, Jupyter Notebook, and data visualization techniques. I am constantly expanding my skills in full-stack development, FlutterFlow app development, and data science to build innovative solutions.</p>
